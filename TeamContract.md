# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions. 

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

* Each teammate agrees to respond to messages in at most how long? 1 day? 2 days? Some other amount of time? 

* What things should a teammate notify you about? (Examples: if they think they won't be able to meet a deadline, if they have to miss lecture, etc.)

* Respectful and inclusive behaviour are necessary for smooth and productive communication. What are some respectful and inclusive behaviours you expect when communicating with each other during lectures, labs, or outside of class? (Examples: Actively listening to each team members ideas, giving everyone a chance to meaningfully contribute, etc.)

---We use discord to communicate. We use @mail.utoronto.ca as our platform to send important messages.

## Decision Making

* How will decisions about your team project be made? (Examples: By majority vote, by unanimous vote, etc.)

---We make decisions by voting and taking the majority vote, but everyone should explain their reasoning.
## Conflict resolution

* How will your team resolve conflicts? (Example: by listening to each other's side of the issue and attempting to reach a compromise. By consulting a TA or instructor as a team, if a resolution has not yet been reached.)

---We will discuss and find ways to resolve conflicts, if we have an unresolvable issue, we will seek help from the TA and the professor.

## Accountability

* Reliability and accountability are also important aspects of teamwork. What are the responsibilities of each team member? (Example: completing their share of the work in a timely manner, seeking assistance from teammates/TAs/instructors when required, etc.)
